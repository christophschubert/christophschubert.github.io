## Errata

### Appendix A


**A-18**: last line: bus should be 32 bit wide

**A-19**: caption of Figure A.3.6: '64 times' -> '32 times'

**A-20**: Check yourself: shouldn't `C` be the right answer?

**A-20, A-21**: Last sentence on page A20 and first sentence on page A21 are near-duplicates.

**A-35**: Suggestion: Figure A.5.13: add a row `1100` for NOR.

**A-37**: 
- Check yourself (rather: answer on A-86): I believe (1) is correct.
- Figure A.5.16: Why parameter AluOp? Shouldn't all assignments be done to `ALUCtl`?

**A-40**: 
- Definition of `P3`: duplicate multiplication symbol.
- Last line before final equation: 'A-40' -> 'A-39'
