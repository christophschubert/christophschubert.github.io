On vacation, Netherlands

- finished reading "AI Superpowers."

	**Verdict:** nice discussion on the difference between "age of discovery" and "age of implementation" and the advantage Chinese startups are having due to their experience of quick iteration and "startup grind", but the pathos in the latter chapters is pretty hard to bear. With respect to the vision on how a society might look like in the age of super-productivity due to the widespread use of AI, I would have like the author to also look at more 'social' economies such as in Europe. Instead, the only mention of continental Europe is in the context of GDPR.
- started working through "7 Concurrency Models in 7 Weeks"
